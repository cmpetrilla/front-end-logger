# Front-end logger

This is a customizable front-end Javascript logger that wraps the `console` functions.

## Usage
Included is a single `Logger` class that you can use to create instances of the custom logger. It's turned off by default, but you can set a threshold for the messages. For example, if you only want error-level messages, you can use this custom logger to suppress info, warn, and debug messages.

This also allows you to create a logger with a context, which is a message that is prepended to the corresponding console function.

See below for usage examples. You can test this live for yourself through the index fileâ€”a new logger instance will be available on `window.logger`.

## Example with errors
This assumes you want to create a custom logger that only shows error messages.

1. Create a new logger with `new Logger()`.
2. Set the level with `logger.setLevel(logger.level.ERROR)`.
3. Call the console function with `logger.ERROR('test')`.

This also applies to the `warn`, `info`, and `debug`.

## Example with context
This assumes you've already instantiated Logger on variable `logger`.

1. Create a new context with `let loggerWithContext = logger.context('new context')`.
2. Call the console function with `loggerWithContext.error('test')` (output will be `new context error`).

The context shares the same threshold as `logger`.

## Test coverage
This uses Mocha and Chai for unit tests. To set up the repo locally and run unit tests, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo.
2. In the root directory of this repo, run `npm install`.
3. In the same directory, run `npm test` to run unit tests.
